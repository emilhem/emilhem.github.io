Hej!

My name is Emil Hemdal and this is my website and blog.

Previously I had a plain info website, but I feel I sit on knowledge that I yearn to share with the world. My hope is that I can fill this website with random useful or interesting things. Some posts will likely be in Swedish if they cover topics that are irrelevant if you live outside of Sweden.

I'm a Computer Engineer with a Master of Science in Engineering (Civilingenj√∂r) from Chalmers. My strengths lie withing Software Development, DevOps, and Security.

## CV

- [English](/cv/CV_Emil_Hemdal_English.pdf)

Still not entirely happy with my CV format, but it is what it is for now.
